The context clearly states that customers can sign up for product notifications to be alerted when an out-of-stock item becomes available again, which contradicts the chatbot's response. Additionally, the chatbot's answer fails to provide any relevant information or alternatives to request restocking of the item, making it entirely unnecessary for human service intervention.</td>\n",
